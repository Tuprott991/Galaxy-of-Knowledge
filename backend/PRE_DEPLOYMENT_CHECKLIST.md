gcloud services enable containerregistry.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable secretmanager.googleapis.com
```

- [ ] Cloud Build API enabled

- [ ] Billing account linked to project
- [ ] You have Cloud Run Admin role (or Owner/Editor)

## 7. Secrets Management

### Secret Manager Setup
- [ ] Understand that `.env` will be stored as secret
- [ ] Understand that `service_account.json` will be stored as secret
- [ ] Secrets will be mounted to container at runtime
- [ ] Secrets are not included in Docker image

### Secret Names (will be created by script)
- [ ] `galaxy-env` - for .env file
- [ ] `galaxy-service-account` - for service_account.json

## 8. Deployment Script

### Windows PowerShell Script
- [ ] `deploy-cloud-run.ps1` exists
- [ ] Script is readable (check encoding)
- [ ] Set execution policy if needed:
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
  ```

### Environment Variables
- [ ] Set `$env:GCP_PROJECT_ID` or be ready to enter when prompted
- [ ] Set `$env:GCP_REGION` or use default (us-central1)

## 9. Resource Configuration

### Review Resource Settings (in deployment script)
- [ ] Memory: 2Gi (can increase if needed)
- [ ] CPU: 2 (can increase if needed)
- [ ] Min instances: 1 (or 0 to save costs)
- [ ] Max instances: 10 (adjust based on expected traffic)
- [ ] Concurrency: 80 (requests per container)
- [ ] Timeout: 300 seconds (5 minutes)

### Authentication
- [ ] Decide: Public (`--allow-unauthenticated`) or Private
- [ ] Current default: Public (anyone can access)
- [ ] Change if needed: `--no-allow-unauthenticated`

## 10. Cost Awareness

### Understand Cloud Run Pricing
- [ ] CPU/Memory costs: ~$0.065 per vCPU-hour
- [ ] Request costs: First 2M free, then $0.40/million
- [ ] Networking: Egress charges apply
- [ ] Estimate monthly cost based on usage

### Cost Controls
- [ ] Set max-instances to limit runaway costs
- [ ] Consider min-instances: 0 for dev, 1+ for prod
- [ ] Set up budget alerts in GCP Console
- [ ] Review pricing calculator

## 11. Networking & Security

### Cloud SQL Connection (if applicable)
- [ ] Cloud SQL instance running
- [ ] Connection method chosen:
  - [ ] Cloud SQL Proxy (recommended)
  - [ ] Private IP (requires VPC)
  - [ ] Public IP with authorized networks
- [ ] Update deployment script with `--add-cloudsql-instances` if needed

### CORS Configuration
- [ ] Frontend URL will be whitelisted (or using `*` for development)
- [ ] Review CORS settings in `main.py`
- [ ] Update for production if needed

## 12. Monitoring Setup (Optional but Recommended)

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Plan to set up error reporting
- [ ] Plan to set up uptime checks
- [ ] Plan to set up log-based alerts
- [ ] Set up notification channels (email, Slack, etc.)

## 13. Documentation Review

### Read Documentation
- [ ] Read `CLOUD_RUN_DEPLOYMENT.md` completely
- [ ] Understand `DOCKER_QUICKSTART.md` commands
- [ ] Review `DOCKER_CLOUD_RUN_SUMMARY.md`
- [ ] Keep links handy for troubleshooting

## 14. Backup & Rollback Plan

### Before First Deployment
- [ ] Commit all code changes to Git
- [ ] Push to remote repository
- [ ] Tag current version: `git tag v1.0-pre-deployment`
- [ ] Know how to rollback if needed

### Rollback Strategy
- [ ] Can redeploy previous image version
- [ ] Have database backup (if applicable)
- [ ] Can switch back to old infrastructure if needed

## 15. Final Checks

### Code Quality
- [ ] All code committed to Git
- [ ] No uncommitted changes
- [ ] `.gitignore` includes sensitive files
- [ ] No TODO comments for critical issues

### Testing
- [ ] All async functions have `await`
- [ ] Database pool initialized properly
- [ ] No known bugs in critical paths
- [ ] Health check endpoint works

### Environment
- [ ] In correct directory: `cd backend`
- [ ] Docker daemon is running
- [ ] Logged into `gcloud`: `gcloud auth list`
- [ ] Correct project selected: `gcloud config get-value project`

## ðŸš€ Ready to Deploy?

If ALL boxes above are checked, you're ready to deploy!

### Run Deployment
```powershell
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Run deployment script
.\deploy-cloud-run.ps1
```

### During Deployment
The script will:
1. âœ… Enable GCP APIs
2. âœ… Build Docker image (5-10 minutes)
3. âœ… Create secrets in Secret Manager
4. âœ… Deploy to Cloud Run (2-5 minutes)
5. âœ… Run health check

### After Deployment
- [ ] Service URL received
- [ ] Health check passed
- [ ] API docs accessible at `/docs`
- [ ] Test key endpoints
- [ ] Monitor logs for errors
- [ ] Update frontend with new backend URL

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Immediate
- [ ] Test all major API endpoints
- [ ] Check Cloud Run logs for errors
- [ ] Verify database connectivity
- [ ] Test MCP Server functionality
- [ ] Update frontend environment variables

### Within 24 Hours
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts
- [ ] Configure custom domain (if needed)
- [ ] Enable HTTPS (automatic on Cloud Run)
- [ ] Review resource usage
- [ ] Check costs in Billing

### Ongoing
- [ ] Monitor logs daily
- [ ] Review costs weekly
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Rebuild image monthly for security updates

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails, check:
1. Error messages in terminal
2. Cloud Build logs in GCP Console
3. Cloud Run logs: `gcloud run logs read`
4. Service status: `gcloud run services describe`
5. Review this checklist again
